# Roadmap

You can explore Project tab in the repo to see what work items will be processed for concrete version. 

As for version 0.2 we plan to:
* Improve UX by providing more ways to control transparent window (toolbars, tray, etc). Concrete implementation will be discussed later.
* Add options to apply basic transformations (rotation, translation, zoom, etc).
* Extend UI of the main window to support more functions and have more clean appearance.
* Introduce Avalonia client to support multiple operation systems.
* Provide user settings to choose some default parameters.
* Add localization (Ukrainian and, probably Russian).

In further perspective we have such goals:
* Extend list of supported formats.
* Add support for vector formats.
* Add support for 3D formats.
* Add opportunity to apply effects on images.
